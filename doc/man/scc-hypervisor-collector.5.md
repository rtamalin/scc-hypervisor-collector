# NAME

**scc-hypervisor-collector** - SUSE Customer Center hypervisor
collector configuration files.

# DESCRIPTION

The **scc-hypervisor-collector(1)** tool depends upon configuration
settings that specify the hypervisors that it needs to query and the
credientials that it will use to upload the collected details to the
SUSE Customer Center.

# DEFAULT CONFIGURATION FILES

By default the **scc-hypervisor-collector(1)** will look for it's
configuration files in the **~/.config/scc-hypervisor-collector**
directory of the non-root user account that is running the command.

# ACCESS AND OWNERSHIP

For security reasons only the non-root user that is running the
**scc-hypervisor-collector** command should be able to access the
specified configuration files.

# CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW

The configuration settings must be specified in YAML format, and must
contain the following top level entries:

**credentials**
  : A collection of credentials that will be used by the tool.

**backends**
  : A list of hypervisors that should be queried to obtain the relevant
    details.

## CREDENTIALS

The **credentials** collection must contain an **scc** entry, which
in turn must contain the **username** and **password** that will be
used to upload the collected details to the SUSE Customer Center.

## BACKENDS

The **backends** entry is a list of collections of the settings that
are needed to successfully connect to the specified hypervisor in
order to retrieve the required details.

Each entry must contain the following:

**id**
  : Specifies the logical name that will be used to identify the
    associated hypervisor.

**module**
  : The type of the hypervisor. Currently one of 'VMWare', 'Libvirt'.

The other settings that must be specified are dependent upon the type
of hypervisor being queried, and can be seen by running
**virtual-host-gatherer --list**.

## VMWARE (VCENTER) HYPERVISOR SETTINGS

The 'VMware' **module** type can be used to retrieve the relevant
details from VMWare vCenter solutions and requires the following
additional settings:

**hostname**
  : The hostname of the VMWare vCenter to connect to. Note that if
    an IP Adress is specified, it must also be included in any
    associated TLS Certificate if using a secured connection.

**port** (optional)
  : The network port to connect to. Defaults to 443 (HTTPS).

**username**
  : The username to be used for authentication purposes.

**password**
  : The password to be used for authentication purposes.

## LIBVIRT HYPERVISOR SETTINGS

The 'Libvirt' **module** type can be used to retrieve the relevant
details from Libvirt (QEMU/KVM) hypervisors and requires the
following settings:

**uri**
  : Specifies the URI to be used to connect to the target Libvirt
    hypervisor.

**sasl_username** (optional)
  : The SASL Username to be used for SASL authentication.

**sasl_password** (optional)
  : The SASL Password to be used for SASL authentication.

Refer to the **SUSE Virtualization Guide** -> **Managing Virtual
Machines with Libvirt** -> **Connecting and Authorizing**
documentation associated with your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
release for specific details about configuring remote connection
types.

### Supported Libvirt URIs

While **xen** connection URIs may work, the primary focus for
development and testing has been on **qemu** (QEMU/KVM) Libvirt
hypervisor nodes:

**qemu+ssh**
  : This connection type requires that you have setup an appropriate
    SSH key that permits passwordless SSH connection to the target
    system, and that the target account has the required privileges
    to be able to query the relevant details using read-only type
    requests.

**qemu+tls**
  : This connection type requires that you have setup x509 client
    and server certs appropriately on both the target hypervisor
    host and the system on which **scc-hypervisor-collector** will
    be running. See the Virtualization Guide for your SUSE Linux
    Enterprise Server release for more details.
